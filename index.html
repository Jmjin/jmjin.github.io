    				<h2>Hello, I'm Jaemin!</h2>
	                <p>I was born in South Korea, but I'm basically a Canadian since I moved to Toronto when I was very young. Currently I'm on my 3rd year studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.</p>
	                <h2>Engineer in the Making</h2>
	                <p>In 2010, I started out my postsecondary studies in Mechatronics Engineering, a multidisciplinary program with focus on various fields of engineering. Unfortunately, I lost interest in the courses and wanted to specialize in one field that I could truly be passionate about. Thanks to several software-related internships, I realized my passion for programming and switched into Software Engineering program at the end of 2012. And since then, I have never looked back! I have now worked at FIVE different software companies where I have enjoyed various development types: applications, web, and mobile.</p>
	                <h2>More About Me</h2>
	                <p>Besides anything related to work or education, I'm a die-hard sports fan, especially basketball. I also enjoy city nightlife, discovering restaurants and visiting some cool places around the city. I like reading people's blogs and various feeds on Quora where I find valuable sources for life and tech inspirations.</p>
                    <p>Now I would like to formally share my story - <a href="Jaemin Jin Resume.pdf" target="_blank">My Résumé</a>.</p>
